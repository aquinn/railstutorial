Rails Tutorial
---------------
important points

Chapter One
===========


Chapter Two
===========
scaffold a user with 2 fields
explanation of function of going to localhost:3000 in browser
1. browser requests /users url
2. router routes /users to the index action of the Users controller
3. the index action asks the User model to retrieve all the users (Users.all)
4. User model pulls all the users from the database
5. model returns list of users to controller
6. controller captures the users in a @users variable, and passes it to the index view
7. view uses embedded ruby to render the page as html 
8. controller passes html to browser.

in the controller we have many actions
index show new edit , create update destroy
create update and destroy dont usually render pages
get - index, show, new, edit
post - create
put - update
delete - destroy

@ variables (instance variables) are automatically accessible by the view

2.3.2

add validations to model

$rails console 
when server is running, you can do things like
first_user= User.first # gets first user to variable
first_user.microposts # gets associated microposts
exit

:users means a symbol.

Chapter 3
=========
Static pages - rails can handle truly static pages, the views can be raw html

Testing
TDD
adding an about page - test first
using rspec
add autotest rails to project
$autotest
runs tests in spec/ when files change
write some tests

Chapter 4
=========
Rails flavoured ruby

Blueprint

got to chapter 5

Chapter 5
=========

Integration tests- we want to create alias routes like /pages/about => /about
you cant test this in the controller so you need
rails g integration_test layout_links
